# Compiler Project

This project implements a basic compiler, showcasing fundamental techniques in compiler construction. It includes various stages of compilation such as:

- **Lexical Analysis**: Tokenizing input code.
- **Syntax Analysis**: Building parse trees.
- **Semantic Analysis**: Checking the meaning of the code.

## Features
- Written in C
- Supports custom grammar and simple expressions

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CesarHPMP/compiler.git
   ```
2. Simply execute the .zsh file after cloning. If unable to, I recommend writing a python script to execute and test output.
